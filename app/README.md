## Trip Planner (WIP)
### Goals 
[ ] Display saved trips and places to visit for each trip on a map with markers representing the 'places to visit'. 
[ ] Display 'places to visit' with location name and details. 
[ ] When a place to visit is clicked on, automatically navigate to the selected place/marker on the map. 
[ ] As a user, be able to save trips
[ ] Update responsive design and add a bottom navigation for smaller screen widths.  
      - Design should have a Map button, View Trips/details button and login/logout

[ ] Use Nest.js for the server and Docker/PostgreSQL for the DB
