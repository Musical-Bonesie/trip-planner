## Trip Planner Backend (Nestjs, Docker, PostgreSQL)
 

 #### Steps to run locally 🏡: 
** Settings are found in docker-compose.yml
 1. terminal> `docker compose up dev-db -d `
   - To check the container is successfully running:
      -  `docker ps`
   - Check to see if database is running in docker
     - `docker logs $LogNumberGoesHere`
2. How to access and connect to the Database
    - There are lot's of different ways to do this but for this Prisma will be used. 
  - Install two libs: PrismaCLIand Prisma Client(Here the JavaScript one is used ) 
  - `yarn add -D prisma`
  - `yarn add @prisma/client`
  - Run Prisma CLI (will auto generate some files): `npx prisma init`
  - update the DATABASE_URL found in the autogenerated .env 

3. Add data models in the schema.prisma and update the schema with the changes
   -  `npx prisma migrate dev`
  This does two things: (1) pushes SQL schema to the database (2) run generate command and creates TypeScript types for the schema. 

  - View your fresh DB in Prisma Studio:
  - `npx prisma studio`

4. Create a module to encapsulate the calls to the DB. This way only certain modules will have access to the database. 
    - Create a module called prisma
    - in prisma.service extend the class to PrismaClient
    - Add the needed metadata to super() like the db url
    - In prisma.module make sure to `exports: [PrismaService]` to make it accessible
    - If you want to make the Prisma module available to all modules add the `@Global()` to prisma.module
    - Now you can import this module, wherever it is imported -- that module.service can use dependency injection to get reference to that imported module's service.  
  
*  ex/ auth.module/ *
  ` @Module({
  imports: [PrismaModule],
  controllers: [AuthController],
  providers: [AuthService],
}) `

  ## Prisma Breakdown:

  ### prisma/
  - schema.prisma: Where models will be declared.
  - Important: for the `DATABASE_URL`, prisma will grab the nearest .env file to it.
